            </div>


            <p>
                Munnar rises as three mountain streams merge - Mudrapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundala. 1,600 m above
                sea level, this hill station was once the summer resort of the erstwhile British Government in South
                India. One of the most sought after honeymoon destinations in Kerala, Munnar is replete with resorts
                and logding facilities that fit a wide rage of budgets. Sprawling tea plantations, picturesque
                towns, winding lanes and holiday facilities make this a popular resort town. Among the exotic flora
                found in the forests and grasslands here is the Neelakurinji. This flower which bathes the hills in
                blue once in every twelve years, will bloom next in 2030. Munnar also has the highest peak in South
                India, Anamudi, which towers over 2,695 m.

                    <p>
                        One of the main attractions near Munnar is the Eravikulam National Park. This park is famous for
                        its
                        endangered inhabitant - the Nilgiri Tahr. Spread over an area of 97 sq. km., this park is also
                        home
                        to several species of rare butterflies, animals and birds. A great place for trekking, the park
                        offers a magnificent view of the tea plantations caressed by blankets of mists. The park becomes
                        a
                        hot destination when the hill slopes here get covered in a carpet of blue, resulting from the
                        flowering of the Neelakurinji. It is a plant endemic to this part of the Western Ghats which
                        blooms
                        once in twelve years.

                        Munnar has a legacy of its own when it comes to the origins and evolution of tea plantations.
                        Taking
                        account of this legacy and to preserve and showcase some of the exquisite and interesting

                        the genesis and growth of tea plantations in Kerala's high ranges, a museum exclusively for tea
                        was
                        opened some years ago by Tata Tea in Munnar. This Tea Museum houses artifacts, photographs and
                        machineries; all of which have a story to tell about the origins and growth of tea plantations
                        in
                        Munnar. The museum is located at the Nallathanni Estate of Tata Tea in Munnar and is worth a
                        visit.
